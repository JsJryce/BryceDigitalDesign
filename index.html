      <h2>Introduction/Experience</h2>
      <p>Hey! I’m Bryce—game developer, design tinkerer, and iced‑coffee aficionado. Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I show off the video games and digital designs I’ve been building. I’m excited to share the results of my efforts, and I hope you enjoy exploring what I’ve created.

      My time at the Timothy Smith Network has been a truly valuable and unique experience. I appreciated the supportive and welcoming community, as well as the flexibility during breaks and lunchtime. The environment at TSN fosters learning and collaboration—there’s always someone available to help, and you’re encouraged to grow without fear of judgment.

      If you're looking for an opportunity to gain practical skills, meet great people, and earn money along the way, I would highly recommend TSN. It’s been an incredibly rewarding experience that I’ve genuinely enjoyed.

      <h2>My Interests</h2>
      <p>I was drawn to TSN because it combines my passion for playing video games with the opportunity to learn how to create them. I appreciate that the program allows me to explore both game design and tech your health, while also gaining experience across different platforms and connecting with a diverse network of people who could be valuable in the future.</p>

      <h2>Who I worked with</h2>
      <p>I’m truly grateful for the opportunity to have worked at TSN. During my time here, I’ve had the pleasure of meeting some incredible people, including the dedicated DDI instructors—Amanda, Niara, and Poline—whose support and energy made a lasting impact on me. I’m also thankful to have connected with Executive Director Milton Irving, whose warmth and leadership have made my experience all the more memorable from day one.</p>
